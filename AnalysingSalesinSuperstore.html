								<h3>Introduction</h3>
									<p>
										In this project we used <b>Excel Power Query</b> for data <b>Preprocessing</b> and <b>Transforamtion</b> and <b>Power BI</b> for <b>visualization.</b>
										<br>
										Throughout this challenge, we will identify some interesting questions within an App Store Games dataset.
									</p>
								<h3>Questions</h3>
									<li>What is the 5 most popular games from 2008 to 2019 yearly?</li>
									<li>What game developer had the highest average game rating?</li>
									<li>Who are the 3 game developers to have most income from their app store games during 2008 to 2019?</li>
									<li>What is the average rating and price trend for the games from 2008 to 2019?</li>
									<li>Which is the most popular language for the games in App Store from 2008 to 2019?</li>
									<li>What are the 3 games to have most user rating count from 2016 to 2019?</li>
									<li>What are the most popular game genres every 3 years since 2008?</li>
									<li>For the new developers to start App Store, what is the price recommendation for them?</li>
									<li>For the new developers to start App Store, what is the genre recommendation for them?</li>
									<li>Can we find any correlation between genre, game size and size ( bytes)?</li>
									<br>
								<h3>Recommendation</h3>
									<p>
										The recommended pricing strategy for new developers is <b>3.40 $.</b> To gain acceptance, 
										it's advisable to offer a free version initially before transitioning to a paid model. 
										The 3.40 $ price point was chosen as it reflects the average cost of paid games.
										<br>
										The recommended genres for new developers is <b>Simulation, Strategy, Action, Puzzle.</b>
										<br>
										Am think there is no correlation between genre, game size
										<br>
										I found over <b>9400</b> brows in this data that didn't have a <b>rate and number of rates,</b>
										so I <b>hide</b> this data to get a correct result after that, the total games I worked on were <b>7561</b> games
										<br>
										I assume that all users who rated these paid games are the ones who spent money on these games.
